## **Part 2**

Perform sentiment analysis on the given dataset. The tweets have been pulled from Twitter and manual tagging has been done. Do the pre - processing and split the dataset into TRAIN and TEST datasets. Create a model which classifies the given data into one of the given labels. And also provide the approach followed step by step.

  An LSTM network is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can learn long-term dependencies between time steps of sequence data. A word embedding layer maps a      sequence of word indices to embedding vectors and learns the word embedding during training.Embedding layer enables us to convert each word into a fixed length vector of defined size. The resultant vector is a dense one with having real values instead of just 0's and 1's. The fixed length of word vectors helps us to represent words in a better way along with reduced dimensions
